                        I received a job offer mind course and the subjects i
                        learned were current, if not more so, in the company i
                        joined. I honestly feel i got every pennys worth.

                    I was a geneticist for many year before joining the bootcamp
                    I have been looking to make a transition and have heard of 
                    people how had an amazing time here. I signed up for the free 
                    intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly t
                    hereafter. The next 12 weeks were the best and most grueling
                    time of my life. Since completing the course, i've successfully 
                    switched careers working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        "Before joinning the bootcamp, I've never written
                        a line of code.I needed some instructions from professionals
                        who helpt me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                        to enroll by a former student of theirs who could on say wonderful
                        things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                        They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for 
                        ASSISTANCE. the agile team project in particular, was outstanding.
                        It took my learning to the next level in ways that no tutorial ever could.
                        Infact,I've offen referred to it as an example of my development
                        experience. It certainly helpt me land a job as a fullstack developer after receiving
                        multiple offers. 100% recommended".
